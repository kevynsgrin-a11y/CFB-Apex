/**
 * Weekly Injury Report — data layer (college football).
 *
 * Two layers, kept separate on purpose:
 *  1. ESPN BASE — injury statuses fetched at build time from ESPN's free
 *     college football feed. Always attributed to ESPN.
 *  2. EDITORIAL RESEARCH — practice participation, likelihood-to-play with
 *     confidence, and sourced sentiment from beat reporting + verified
 *     social accounts. Ingested weekly from data/injury-research/current.json
 *     via scripts/ingest-injury-research.mjs. Absent file = nothing published.
 *
 * Long-term ledger = out for the season or expected out MORE than 2 weeks.
 * Everything uncertain lives in the week-to-week watch.
 * Null means not published — never zero, never guessed.
