# Decision log

## D-001 — Preserve the Sites Vinext foundation

The empty workspace was initialized with the bundled Cloudflare-compatible Vinext/Next.js starter. This satisfies the preview-hosting constraint without introducing a second framework.

## D-002 — Fixture-first vertical slices

Priority 1–5 experiences will be functional against deterministic typed fixtures before any credentialed adapter is enabled. Live adapters remain typed external dependencies.

## D-003 — Single application with modular domain boundaries

The MVP remains one deployable web app with `lib` and component boundaries rather than a monorepo. This minimizes operational overhead while preserving clean provider, simulation, analytics, and configuration interfaces.

## D-004 — Fictional neutral programs in demo mode

The preview uses clearly invented teams, coaches, players, and destinations. This avoids representing stale synthetic values as facts and avoids unlicensed marks.

## D-005 — Runtime-aligned agent concurrency

Agent concurrency is capped at four because the current environment exposes four slots. Parallel discovery and audit work is read-heavy; write-heavy ownership is sequenced.

## D-006 — Synthetic provenance is a first-class status

Demonstration records use `synthetic`, not `official` or implied-live language. Model cards state exactly which deterministic transforms exist and which validation work does not.

## D-007 — Native disclosure dialog

Odds and DFS remain opt-in. The disclosure uses the browser's native modal semantics for focus containment, Escape handling, and focus restoration while keeping Clean Mode as the default.

## D-008 — Private preview boundary

The release is deployed only through authenticated private Sites hosting. Public launch is a separate decision that requires licensed providers, distributed rate limiting, production load testing, tighter CSP, and legal approval.

## D-009 — Supported dependency baseline

The release uses patched Next/React/Vite/Cloudflare dependencies and Biome for the lint gate. Overrides pin audited transitive packages where upstream ranges otherwise resolve vulnerable versions.
